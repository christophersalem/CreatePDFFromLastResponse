# COVID-19 Patient Screening Form Generator
Inside the JavaScript file is a tool I made to generate a PDF with specific values extracted from a Google Form for a Dental Office.

The resulting PDF is a unique "COVID-19 Patient Screening Form" with values filled in from what the patient input in a Google Form on their phone in the waiting room. This was in the effort to reduce person-to-person contact back in the height of the pandemic.

Here is the Google Form the patients would be sent: https://forms.gle/394X5rt6jEKUYJNWA

Upon submission of the form, my JavaScript tool would be invoked and would generate a new PDF file for that patient and store it on the dental office's Google Drive so that the staff could easily view the response data and also print them out for record keeping.
