# COVID-19 Patient Screen Form Gnerator
Inside the JavaScript file is a tool I made to generate a PDF with specific values extracted from a Google Form.

The resulting PDF is a unique "COVID-19 Patient Screen Form" with values filled in from what a patient input in a Google Form on their phone in the waiting room. This was in the effort to reduce person to person contact back in the height of the pandemic.

Here is the Google Form the patients would be sent: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gw8Fc7L3P2BiZqqr6xUrSPiMb9FJQTM-Pz2HS27OoW4

Upon submission of the form, my JavaScript tool would be invoked and would generate a new PDF file for that patient and store it on the dental office's Google Drive so that the staff could easily view the response data and also print them out for record keeping.
